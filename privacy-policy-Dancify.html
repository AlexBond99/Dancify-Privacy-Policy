    <p>Thank you for using Dancify! Your privacy is important to us, and this privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our app.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>Dancify uses the camera on your device to track your body movements through pose estimation, which is powered by Mediapipe technology. The data collected from the camera is processed in real-time and not stored unless you explicitly choose to save it.</p>

    <p><strong>Data collected:</strong></p>
    <ul>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
