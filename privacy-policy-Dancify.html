    <!-- Privacy Policy for Dancify

Last Updated: 29-08-2024

Thank you for using Dancify! Your privacy is important to us, and this privacy policy outlines how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information when you use our app.

1.	Information We Collect

Dancify uses the camera on your device to track your body movements through pose estimation, which is powered by Mediapipe technology. The data collected from the camera is processed in real-time and not stored unless you explicitly choose to save it.

Data collected:

Camera Feed: The app accesses your camera solely to track your pose and movements for gameplay. The live feed is processed locally on your device.

Recorded Frames: You have the option to save specific frames captured during gameplay. These frames are stored locally on your device and are not shared with us or third parties.


2.	How We Use Your Information

Pose Estimation: The app uses your camera feed to detect and analyze your movements during gameplay. This data is processed locally and not stored unless you choose to save certain frames.

Saved Frames: If you choose to save specific frames, they will be stored on your device. We do not access, store, or transmit any of these frames to our servers or third parties.


3.	Data Storage and Security

Local Storage: Any frames you choose to save are stored on your device. Dancify does not upload, share, or transmit your saved frames to any external servers or third-party services.

Security: We take reasonable steps to protect the information processed and stored on your device. However, the security of data stored on your device depends on the security settings of your device.


4.	Third-Party Services

Dancify uses Mediapipe, an open-source library developed by Google for real-time pose estimation. Mediapipe processes the data locally on your device, and no data is sent to external servers.

5.	Permissions

To provide its functionality, Dancify requires the following permissions:

Camera Access: To track your movements using pose estimation for gameplay.

Storage Access: To save frames that you choose to keep on your device.


6.	Your Choices

Saving Frames: You have complete control over whether or not to save frames during gameplay. If you do not wish to save any data, you can simply decline the option to save frames.

Camera Access: You may disable the camera access through your device settings, but this will limit the functionality of the app.


7.	Children’s Privacy

Dancify is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will take steps to delete that information as quickly as possible.

8.	Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. When we do, we will post the updated policy here with the “Last Updated” date. Please review this policy periodically for any changes.
